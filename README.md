AI for the battle engine [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/orionsbelt-battlegrounds/battle-engine-ai.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/orionsbelt-battlegrounds/battle-engine-ai)
================

The `battle-engine-ai` is part of the [Orion's Belt BattleGrounds](https://github.com/orionsbelt-battlegrounds) project. It mimics the main [battle-engine](https://github.com/orionsbelt-battlegrounds/battle-engine) rules and aims to provide an artificial intelligence module in `scala` to play the game via the [api](https://github.com/orionsbelt-battlegrounds/api).

#### Install and Run

* Download and install [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
* run `git clone git@github.com:orionsbelt-battlegrounds/battle-engine-ai.git`
* run `sbt test`

If everything is ok and we haven't blown up the build, you should have a [valid working copy](https://travis-ci.org/orionsbelt-battlegrounds/battle-engine-ai).
